# AD5274 Python Library

This is a python library for using the Analog AD5274 Digital Rheostat with an I2C interface.  Please see the following link for more information about the HW:  https://www.analog.com/en/products/ad5274.html .  

This library uses the libmraa low level skeleton library for communication (https://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/mraa/)

This has been tested on an Intel Edison, but technically should be able to work on any platform for which libmraa is available.
